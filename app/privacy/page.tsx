        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          ManifestBank™ values transparency and respects user privacy. This Privacy Policy
          explains how information is collected, used, stored, and protected when you use the
          Platform, including The Ether™.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on usage, we may collect account information (email, username), user-submitted
          content (intentions, reflections, entries, messages), usage data (feature interactions,
          timestamps), and device and technical information (IP address, browser type, operating
          system).
        </p>

        <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>
          Information is used to operate and maintain the Platform, enable core features and
          personalization, improve functionality and performance, maintain platform safety and
          integrity, and comply with legal obligations. ManifestBank™ does not sell personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>
          Data is stored using reasonable technical and organizational safeguards. However, no
          digital system can guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          Information may be shared with service providers supporting Platform operations, when
          required by law or legal process, or to protect the rights, safety, or integrity of the
          Platform and its users.
        </p>

        <h2>6. The Ether™ – Messaging &amp; Community Data (Hybrid Model)</h2>
        <p>
          The Ether™ uses a hybrid data retention model. Some messages or interactions are
          retained temporarily. Some content may be retained longer to support continuity,
          moderation, safety, or user experience. Retention duration may vary by feature and
          system requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ether™ data may be processed to deliver communication and community features, enforce
          Platform rules and guidelines, prevent abuse or misuse, and improve Platform
          functionality. Content may be reviewed by automated systems or authorized personnel to
          maintain safety, compliance, and platform integrity. Content shared in public or
          community-visible areas of The Ether™ may be visible to other users based on Platform
          settings.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data is retained only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill Platform purposes,
          legal obligations, or safety requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on jurisdiction, users may have rights to access personal data, request
          correction or deletion, and withdraw consent. Requests can be submitted through official
          support channels.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          ManifestBank™ and The Ether™ are not intended for individuals under the age of 18 (or
          the age of majority in their jurisdiction). The Platform does not knowingly collect
          personal information from minors. If such information is discovered, it will be deleted
          in accordance with applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Platform
          constitutes acceptance of any changes.
        </p>
